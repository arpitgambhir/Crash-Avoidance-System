# Crash-Avoidance-System
This project reports the use of CAMPLinear algorithm and compares it with other algorithms, like Neural Networks, SVM, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes.

I have already extracted the data, which I have included in the Repo.

You will need to change the directories, namely dir1 and dir2. dir1 should contain the path for the parent directory in which all the subdirectories for each PER value are stored. And dir2 should contain the path for the PER 0 directory.
Note: Please note that you will need to provide the absolute path for the directories as shown in the image below.

After you have changed the 2 paths, you can run the code. The default classifier Iâ€™ve defined is the Support Vector Machine. You will need to change the classifiers to test different algorithms.

After all these steps, you can just run the code and wait for 2-3 minutes and the output will appear. The output will show the mean accuracies of algorithms which I have used and the CAMPLinear algorithm. The output will also show the accuracy vs. PER plot, and time taken for each algorithm vs. PER plot.
